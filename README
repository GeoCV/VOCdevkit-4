a small subset of images and annotations from the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset needed to run boda's tests.

retrieved from here:

this indicates that the images are from flikr, and that using them implicitly agrees to flickr's TOS.

it's unclear exactly what the LICENSE of the annotations themselves is.
